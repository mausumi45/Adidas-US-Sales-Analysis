### Data Collection:
- To gather Adidas US sales data from Kaggle, I first navigated to the Kaggle website and created an account. 
- After logging in, I searched for "Adidas US Sales Data" and selected a suitable dataset based on my analysis requirements. 
- Once I downloaded the dataset, I created a data dictionary to better understand the data and its features.

### Dataset Link :
Adidas US Sales Data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset

- Price per Unit: The price of one unit of the product.
- Units Sold: The number of units sold.
- Total Sales: The total sales revenue generated by the sale.
- Operating Profit: The profit generated by the sale, taking into account all associated costs.
- Operating Margin: The percentage of revenue that represents operating profit.
- Sales Method: The method by which the sale was made (e.g., online, in-store, outlet etc.)

### EDA Using Python :
:closed_umbrella: Imported necessary libraries and load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, datetime & warning.

:closed_umbrella: Checked the basic information about the dataset such as shape, size, data types, and missing values using Pandas functions.

:closed_umbrella: Performed descriptive statistics to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of the data using NumPy and Pandas functions.

:closed_umbrella: Visualized the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.

:closed_umbrella: Performed feature engineering to create new features that can provide additional insights into the data.

:closed_umbrella: Correlation analysis to identify the relationships between different features in the dataset.

### EDA Using SQL :
:rocket: Connect to the database: First, connected to the database that contains the dataset using an appropriate database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL

:rocket: View table schema: Used the SQL "DESCRIBE" or "SHOW COLUMNS" statement to view the schema of the table containing the dataset. This will provide information such as column names, data types, and nullability.

:rocket: Check basic statistics: Used SQL aggregation functions such as "COUNT", "SUM", "AVG", "MAX", and "MIN" to calculate basic statistics such as the number of records, sum of values, average, and minimum and maximum values for each column.

:rocket: Identify missing values: Used SQL "WHERE" statement and "IS NULL" or "IS NOT NULL" operator to identify records with missing values.

:rocket: Grouping and aggregation: Used SQL "GROUP BY" statement to group records by one or more columns and calculate summary statistics for each group using SQL aggregation functions.

:rocket: Filtering and sorting: Used SQL "WHERE" statement to filter records based on one or more conditions and "ORDER BY" statement to sort records based on one or more columns.

:rocket: Joins: Used SQL "JOIN" statement to combine multiple tables and extract information that cannot be obtained from a single table.

:rocket: Subqueries: Used SQL subqueries to extract information from a subset of records that satisfy a particular condition or set of conditions.
#### Functions Used :



### EDA Using Excel :
:truck: Check basic information: Used the "Home" tab and the "Find & Select" and "Conditional Formatting" options to check for basic information such as the number of records, data types, and missing values.

:truck: Pivot tables: Used the "Insert" tab and the "PivotTable" option to create pivot tables that summarize the data by grouping records based on one or more columns and calculating summary statistics for each group.

:truck: Charts and graphs: Used the "Insert" tab and the "Charts" and "Sparklines" options to create visualizations such as histograms, line charts, and scatter plots that help to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

:truck: Filtering and sorting: Used the "Data" tab and the "Filter" and "Sort" options to filter and sort records based on one or more columns.
Prepare a report: Use the "Insert" tab and the "Text Box" option to create a report summarizing the findings from the EDA.
